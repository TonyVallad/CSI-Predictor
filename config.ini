[MODEL]
# Available MODEL_ARCH options (only these 4 are actually implemented):
# 
# - resnet50: Default reliable baseline
#   * Parameters: ~23M, Input: 224x224, Memory: ~2GB GPU
#   * Best for: General purpose, fast training, reliable results
#   * Settings: BATCH_SIZE=32-64, LEARNING_RATE=0.001, any optimizer
#
# - chexnet: Medical specialist (DenseNet121 pre-trained on chest X-rays)
#   * Parameters: ~7M, Input: 224x224, Memory: ~2GB GPU  
#   * Best for: Medical domain tasks, good balance of speed/accuracy
#   * Settings: BATCH_SIZE=32-64, LEARNING_RATE=0.0001 (lower for fine-tuning)
#
# - custom1: Lightweight 5-layer CNN
#   * Parameters: ~1M, Input: 224x224, Memory: ~1GB GPU
#   * Best for: Quick prototyping, testing, limited GPU memory
#   * Settings: BATCH_SIZE=64-128, LEARNING_RATE=0.001, any optimizer
#
# - raddino: State-of-the-art for radiology (Microsoft RadDINO)
#   * Parameters: ~86M, Input: 518x518, Memory: ~8GB GPU
#   * Best for: Highest accuracy, medical imaging excellence  
#   * Settings: BATCH_SIZE=4-8, LEARNING_RATE=1e-5, AdamW optimizer
#   * Requires: transformers library (pip install transformers)
#   * Note: Large memory requirements, reduce batch size if OOM errors occur
MODEL_ARCH = resnet50

# Zone Focus Method - How the model analyzes different lung zones:
# 
# - masking: Creates 6 masked versions of each image, processes each separately
#   * Memory: High (processes 6x images), Accuracy: High, Speed: Slower
#   * Best for: Maximum accuracy, sufficient GPU memory available
#
# - spatial_reduction: Single image processing + adaptive pooling to 3x2 grid  
#   * Memory: Low (processes 1x images), Accuracy: Good, Speed: Faster
#   * Best for: Limited GPU memory, faster training, good balance

#   * Best for: ResNet, EfficientNet, DenseNet, and other pre-trained models
#
# - medical: Medical imaging normalization 
#   * Mean: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5], Std: [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]  
#   * Best for: Medical-specific models, domain adaptation
#
# - simple: Simple 0-1 normalization (no mean/std subtraction)
#   * Mean: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], Std: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]
#   * Best for: Custom models, debugging
#
# - custom: User-defined normalization values
#   * Requires: CUSTOM_MEAN and CUSTOM_STD parameters below
#   * Best for: Specialized model requirements
