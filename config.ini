[MODEL]
# Available MODEL_ARCH options (only these 4 are actually implemented):
# 
# - resnet50: Default reliable baseline
#   * Parameters: ~23M, Input: 224x224, Memory: ~2GB GPU
#   * Best for: General purpose, fast training, reliable results
#   * Settings: BATCH_SIZE=32-64, LEARNING_RATE=0.001, any optimizer
#
# - chexnet: Medical specialist (DenseNet121 pre-trained on chest X-rays)
#   * Parameters: ~7M, Input: 224x224, Memory: ~2GB GPU  
#   * Best for: Medical domain tasks, good balance of speed/accuracy
#   * Settings: BATCH_SIZE=32-64, LEARNING_RATE=0.0001 (lower for fine-tuning)
#
# - custom1: Lightweight 5-layer CNN
#   * Parameters: ~1M, Input: 224x224, Memory: ~1GB GPU
#   * Best for: Quick testing, debugging, resource-constrained environments
#   * Settings: BATCH_SIZE=64-128, LEARNING_RATE=0.01, fast training
#
# - raddino: State-of-the-art for radiology (Microsoft's RadDINO)
#   * Parameters: ~86M, Input: 518x518, Memory: ~8GB GPU minimum
#   * Best for: Production deployment, highest accuracy on chest X-rays
#   * Requirements: pip install transformers>=4.30.0
#   * Recommended settings: 
#     BATCH_SIZE=16 (or lower), LEARNING_RATE=0.00001, OPTIMIZER=adamw
#     USE_OFFICIAL_PROCESSOR=true (for best performance)
