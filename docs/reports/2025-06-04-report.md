This document contains topics discussed with my tutor that I need to get some information on and that I must study.

## Metric used to evaluate the model

### What metric is used ?

The model uses **F1-score** as the primary evaluation metric, specifically:
- **F1 Macro**: Average F1-score across all 6 CSI zones (treats all zones equally)
- **F1 Weighted Macro**: F1-score weighted by class frequency (recommended for imbalanced medical data)
- **Per-zone F1**: Individual F1-score for each of the 6 chest zones
- **Overall F1**: F1-score computed across all zones flattened together

Additional metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: Per-zone and overall accuracy
- **Precision/Recall**: Computed for each zone and overall

### How exactly it is used ?

The F1 metrics are implemented using **pure PyTorch** (no scikit-learn dependencies) in `src/metrics.py`:

1. **During Training**: F1 macro is computed at the end of each epoch to track model performance
2. **During Validation**: Both F1 macro and F1 weighted are computed for model selection
3. **Ignore Strategy**: Class 4 ("ungradable") is ignored by default (`ignore_index=4`) to focus on gradable cases for medical interpretation
4. **Confusion Matrix**: Per-zone confusion matrices are computed using PyTorch's `bincount` function
5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: F1 weighted macro is used as the target metric for Optuna/WandB sweeps

### How to improve ?

Current improvements already implemented:
- **Weighted F1**: Accounts for class imbalance in medical data
- **Per-class metrics**: Detailed analysis of each CSI score (0-4)
- **Zone-specific evaluation**: Individual assessment of each lung zone

One way to improve it would be to measure how far off the prediction is from reality.
For example, if the model predicts a score of 0 when it should be 3, it's a big mistake.
But if it predicts a score of 2 instead of 3, it's not so bad.
**This would require implementing ordinal regression or a custom loss function that penalizes based on the distance between predicted and true CSI scores.**
This will need to be implemented at some later point in time. (not for now)

## ResNet50 Model

### How many output fields does this model have ?

The ResNet50 model has **30 output fields** total:
- **6 zones** × **5 classes per zone** = **30 logit outputs**
- Output shape: `[batch_size, 6, 5]`

The 6 zones correspond to different regions of the chest X-ray:
1. `right_sup` - Patient Right Superior
2. `left_sup` - Patient Left Superior  
3. `right_mid` - Patient Right Middle
4. `left_mid` - Patient Left Middle
5. `right_inf` - Patient Right Inferior
6. `left_inf` - Patient Left Inferior

The 5 classes per zone represent CSI scores:
- **0**: Normal
- **1**: Mild congestion
- **2**: Moderate congestion  
- **3**: Severe congestion
- **4**: Unknown/Ungradable

### What metric does it use to optimize ? Loss ?

The model uses **Weighted Cross-Entropy Loss** for optimization:
- **Loss Function**: `WeightedCSILoss` class in `src/train.py`
- **Weighting Strategy**: Classes 0-3 get full weight (1.0), class 4 gets reduced weight (0.3 by default)
- **Purpose**: Reduces importance of "ungradable" class while still learning to predict it
- **Implementation**: Uses `F.cross_entropy()` with class weights

The loss is computed by:
1. Flattening predictions and targets: `[batch_size × 6, 5]` and `[batch_size × 6]`
2. Applying weighted cross-entropy with class weights: `[1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.3]`
3. Averaging across all samples and zones

### Does it give out a Congestion Score Index for the 6 different zones we are interested in ?

**Yes**, the model specifically predicts CSI scores for exactly the 6 zones we are interested in:

**Architecture Details**:
- **Backbone**: ResNet50 extracts features → `[batch_size, 2048]`
- **CSI Head**: 6 parallel linear classifiers, one for each zone
- **Output**: Logits for each zone → `[batch_size, 6, 5]`
- **Prediction**: Argmax of logits gives CSI class (0-4) for each zone

**Zone Mapping**:
```python
zone_names = ["right_sup", "left_sup", "right_mid", "left_mid", "right_inf", "left_inf"]
CSI_COLUMNS = ['right_sup', 'left_sup', 'right_mid', 'left_mid', 'right_inf', 'left_inf']
```

**Output Interpretation**:
- Each zone gets a predicted CSI score from 0-4
- Class 4 represents "ungradable" cases where assessment is not possible
- Classes 0-3 represent increasing levels of pulmonary congestion


### Current Limitation: No Spatial Guidance

The current model has a significant limitation: **it receives the full chest X-ray image without any spatial guidance** and must learn to identify the relevant lung regions on its own. This is extremely challenging given the limited training data available.

**Current Approach**:
- Input: Full chest X-ray image (e.g., 224×224 pixels)
- Model: ResNet50 backbone + 6 parallel classifiers
- Problem: Model must implicitly learn which image regions correspond to each of the 6 lung zones
- Challenge: With limited training data, the model struggles to develop reliable spatial understanding

### Proposed Solution: Zone-Based Masking

To address this limitation, I'm implementing a **zone-based masking approach** that will force the model to focus on specific image regions for each lung zone prediction.

**Implementation Plan**:

1. **Lung Segmentation & Cropping**:
   - Use a segmentation model to identify lung boundaries
   - Crop the image to focus on the lung region
   - This ensures the lungs are properly centered before zone division

2. **Zone Division Strategy**:
   - Divide the cropped image into **6 zones** using a 2×3 grid
   - **Vertical division**: 3 zones (superior, middle, inferior)
   - **Horizontal division**: 2 zones (left, right)
   - This creates the 6 target zones: right_sup, left_sup, right_mid, left_mid, right_inf, left_inf

3. **Mask Application**:
   - Create binary masks for each zone
   - Apply zone-specific masks during training
   - Each classifier receives only the relevant image region for its zone

   **Mask Strategy Options**:

   **Option 1: Segmentation-Based Masks (Future Enhancement)**:
   - If we have access to high-quality lung segmentation masks, we can use them directly
   - Apply the segmentation mask to isolate lung tissue
   - Divide the segmented lung region into 6 zones using anatomical landmarks
   - This would provide the most accurate spatial guidance

   **Option 2: Grid-Based Division (Current Implementation)**:
   - Since segmentation masks may not be available or reliable, we'll use a simpler approach
   - Divide the cropped image into a 2×3 grid as described above
   - This provides reasonable spatial separation while being more robust
   - Each zone gets approximately 1/6 of the image area

   **Implementation Priority**:
   - Start with grid-based division for immediate implementation
   - Evaluate segmentation quality if available
   - Migrate to segmentation-based masks if results show significant improvement
