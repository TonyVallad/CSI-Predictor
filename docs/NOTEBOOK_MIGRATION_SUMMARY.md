# 📚 Notebook Migration Summary

## ✅ **Migration Completed Successfully!**

All Jupyter notebooks have been moved from the project root to the `notebooks/` folder and their relative paths have been updated to absolute paths.

## 📁 **Moved Notebooks**

The following 8 notebooks were successfully moved to `notebooks/`:

1. **`Download ArchiMed Images V1.3_PreTrained.ipynb`** (80KB) - Main enhanced notebook with black margin elimination
2. **`Download ArchiMed Images V1.2_Fixed.ipynb`** (41KB) - Fixed version with error handling
3. **`Download ArchiMed Images V1.2.ipynb`** (42KB) - Enhanced version with lung segmentation
4. **`Download ArchiMed Images V1.1.ipynb`** (34KB) - Improved download functionality
5. **`Download ArchiMed Images V1.0.ipynb`** (29KB) - Original version
6. **`CSV_Preprocessing v1.1.ipynb`** (32KB) - Enhanced CSV preprocessing
7. **`CSV_Preprocessing v1.0.ipynb`** (14KB) - Basic CSV preprocessing
8. **`CSV_Exploration.ipynb`** (5.8KB) - Data exploration notebook

## 🔄 **Path Updates**

**Total path updates made: 17**

All relative paths have been converted from:
```python
# OLD (relative paths)
CSV_FOLDER = "../../data/Paradise_CSV/"
DOWNLOAD_PATH = '../../data/Paradise_Test_DICOMs'
IMAGES_PATH = '../../data/Paradise_Test_Images'
MASKS_PATH = '../../data/Paradise_Masks'
```

To:
```python
# NEW (absolute paths)
CSV_FOLDER = "/home/pyuser/wkdir/CSI-Predictor/data/Paradise_CSV/"
DOWNLOAD_PATH = '/home/pyuser/wkdir/CSI-Predictor/data/Paradise_Test_DICOMs'
IMAGES_PATH = '/home/pyuser/wkdir/CSI-Predictor/data/Paradise_Test_Images'
MASKS_PATH = '/home/pyuser/wkdir/CSI-Predictor/data/Paradise_Masks'
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Migration**

1. **🗂️ Better Organization**: All notebooks are now centralized in the `notebooks/` folder
2. **🔗 Portable Paths**: Absolute paths work regardless of where notebooks are run from
3. **🚀 Environment Independence**: No more path issues when running in different environments
4. **📁 Cleaner Root**: Project root is now cleaner with only essential files
5. **🔧 Easier Maintenance**: All notebook-related files are in one location

## ✅ **Verification**

- ✅ All 8 notebooks successfully moved to `notebooks/` folder
- ✅ All 17 relative paths updated to absolute paths  
- ✅ No notebooks remain in project root
- ✅ No relative paths (`../`) remain in any notebook
- ✅ All paths point to `/home/pyuser/wkdir/CSI-Predictor/data/`

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

The notebooks are now ready to use in the new structure. You can:

1. **Run notebooks** from the `notebooks/` folder
2. **Access data** using the absolute paths (no path issues)
3. **Deploy** to any environment without path modifications
4. **Collaborate** with team members without path conflicts
